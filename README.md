## vrpn_clinet_ros  

This package is aimed at porting the original vrpn client which is based on ROS1 melodic to ROS2 dashing env.

After downloading the files, you need to source both melodic & dahsing to build.  
Sourcing both bash files consequently will do the job.  

```bash  
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash  
source /opt/ros/dashing/setup.bash  
```  
  
Change the IP address to your optitrack server pc in [/vrpn_client_ros/config/sample.params.yaml](https://github.com/n00Nspr1ng/deepRacer-with-Optitrack/blob/main/vrpn_client_ros/config/sample.params.yaml)
